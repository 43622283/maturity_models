# OpenSource Maturity Model

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSource_Maturity_Model

The Open Source Maturity Model (OMM) is a methodology for assessing Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) and more specifically the FLOSS development process.

## OMM objectives

OMM objectives are:

1. To provide FLOSS communities a basis for developing products efficiently and making their products trustworthy for the potential customers, and also for integrating companies.

* To provide FLOSS integrators a basis for evaluating the processes used by the FLOSS communities.


## OMM is a model and methodology

OMM is interchangeably referred to as model and methodology.

1. It is first a model that contains all elements that have to be assessed.

2. It is also a set of rules and guidelines describing how to conduct the assessment process.


## OMM levels

OMM is organized in levels, each level is building on and including the trustworthy elements (TWE) at the lower level:

1. Basic level: achieved by adopting a few necessary practices in the FLOSS development process
2. Intermediate level: achieved by fulfilling all trustworthy elements from the basic level and required trustworthy elements from the intermediate level.
3. Advanced level: achieved by fulfilling all trustworthy elements from basic and intermediate levels and required trustworthy elements from the advanced level.


## 1. Basic level

Basic level elements:

* PDOC: Product Documentation
* STD: Use of Established and Widespread Standards
* QTP: Quality of Test Plan

* ENV: Technical Environment
* DFCT: Number of Commits and Bug Reports
* MST: Maintainability and Stability
* CM: Configuration Management
* PP1: Project Planning Part 1
* REQM: Requirements Management
* RDMP1: Availability and Use of a (product) roadmap


## 2. Intermediate level

Intermediate level elements:

* RDMP2: Availability and Use of a (product) roadmap
* STK: Relationship between Stakeholders
* PP2: Project Planning Part 2
* PMC: Project Monitoring and Control
* TST1: Test Part 1
* DSN1: Design Part 1
* PPQA: Process and Product Quality Assurance


## 3. Advanced level

Advanced level elements:

* PI: Product Integration
* RSKM: Risk Management
* TST2: Test Part 2
* DSN2: Design 2
* RASM: Results of third party assessment
* REP: Reputation
* CONT: Contribution to FLOSS Product from SW Companies
