<h2><a name="maturity-model-levels">Maturity model levels</a></h2>

A maturity model typical has sequential levels.

For example, a maturity model can have levels 1-3, generally corresponding to these meanings:

* 1. Basic
* 2. Intermediate
* 3. Advanced

For example, a maturity model can have levels 0-5, generally corresponding to these meanings:

* 0. None, Never, Novice
* 1. Informal, Implicit, Irregular, Inconsistent, Individual Usage
* 2. Developing, Describing, Department Usage
* 3. Defining, Detailing, Disciplined, Distributed Usage
* 4. Managing, Measuring, Mainstreaming, Majority Usage
* 5. Ongoing, Optimizing, Orchestrating, Opportunity-creating, Organization-wide Usage


<h2><a name="top-down-vs-bottom-up">Top-down vs. bottom-up</a></h2>

Two approaches for designing maturity models exist:

* Top-down approach: a fixed number of maturity stages or levels is specified first, then corroborated with characteristics (typically in form of specific assessment items) that support the initial assumptions about how maturity evolves.

* Bottom-up approach: distinct characteristics or assessment items are determined first, then clustered in a second step into maturity levels to induce a more general view of the different steps of maturity evolution.
