A maturity model typical has sequential levels.

For example, a maturity model can have levels 1-3, generally corresponding to these meanings:

1. Basic

Two approaches for designing maturity models exist:

* Top-down approach: a fixed number of maturity stages or levels is specified first, then corroborated with characteristics (typically in form of specific assessment items) that support the initial assumptions about how maturity evolves.

* Bottom-up approach: distinct characteristics or assessment items are determined first, then clustered in a second step into maturity levels to induce a more general view of the different steps of maturity evolution.
