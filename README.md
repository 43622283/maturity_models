<h2><a name="maturity-model-levels">Maturity model levels</a></h2>

A maturity model typical has sequential levels.

For example, a maturity model can have levels 1-3, generally corresponding to these meanings:

* 1. Basic
* 2. Intermediate
* 3. Advanced

For example, a maturity model can have levels 0-5, generally corresponding to these meanings:

* 0. None, Never, Negligible, Not Applicable
* 1. Initial, Informal, Implicit, Irregular, Inconsistent, Individual-usage.
* 2. Developing, Describing, Duplicating, Department-usage.
* 3. Standardizing, Specifying, Scaling, Service-oriented, Segment-usage
* 4. Managing, Measuring, Mainstreaming, Mission-oriented, Mass-usage
* 5. Optimizing, Orchestrating, Ongoing, Opportunity-oriented, Organization-usage


<h2><a name="maturity-model-process-perspectives">Maturity model process perspectives</a></h2>

P3M3® describes process perspectives. These can be assessed at all maturity model levels.

* Control Management: how well the organization maintains control of the initiatives currently ‘in flight’.
* Benefits Management: how well the organization defines, tracks and ensures achievement of performance improvement from the investment.
* Financial Management: how well the organization manages and controls the investment through business cases and budgetary control.
* Stakeholder Management: how well the initiatives engage with and communicate with the external environment to minimize the negative implications engagement can achieve.
* Organizational Governance: how well the organization controls the initiation and alignment of its investments with the corporate strategy.
* Risk Management: how well the organization focuses on and mitigates the impact of threats and the leveraging of opportunities.
* Resource Management: how well the organization develops its own talent and utilizes the opportunities from the supply chain to overcome peaks and troughs.


<h2><a name="top-down-vs-bottom-up">Top-down vs. bottom-up</a></h2>

Two approaches for designing maturity models exist:

* Top-down approach: a fixed number of maturity stages or levels is specified first, then corroborated with characteristics (typically in form of specific assessment items) that support the initial assumptions about how maturity evolves.

* Bottom-up approach: distinct characteristics or assessment items are determined first, then clustered in a second step into maturity levels to induce a more general view of the different steps of maturity evolution.
