Maturity models typical have sequential levels.

For example, many popular maturity models have levels that are ranked 0-5, and often with these kinds of general characteristics:

0. None, Never, Novice
1. Informal, Implicit, Individual Usage
2. Developing, Describing, Department Usage
3. Defining, Detailing, Distributed Usage
4. Managing, Measuring, Majority Usage
5. Ongoing, Optimizing, Organization Usage

Two approaches for designing maturity models exist:

* Top-down approach: a fixed number of maturity stages or levels is specified first, then corroborated with characteristics (typically in form of specific assessment items) that support the initial assumptions about how maturity evolves.

* Bottom-up approach: distinct characteristics or assessment items are determined first, then clustered in a second step into maturity levels to induce a more general view of the different steps of maturity evolution.
